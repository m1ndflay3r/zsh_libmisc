## zzcat - *simple cat implementation, written in 100% pure zsh.*

*contains functionality of fox, fox-ec, and fox-fr.*

------------------------------------

**examples:**

    zzcat /path/to/file

    echo "myaah" | zzcat

    zzcat <<EOF
    some text
    EOF

    zzcat "myaah"

------------------------------------
*very, very slow in comparison to fox, though much more lightweight. Use only where small amounts of data need to be handled.*
