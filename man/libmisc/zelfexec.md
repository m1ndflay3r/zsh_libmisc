## **zelfexec** - A highly versatile *elfexec* implementation, written in a mixture of C and zsh.
  
*Inspired by abbats' elfexec (https://github.com/abbat/elfexec - used for reference only, all code original)*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

execute ELF binaries piped to stdin without writing them to disk. 


  Primary differences to abbat's *elfexec* implementation:
  
  - it's in a zsh library!
    
  - stdin of the child process can be handled separately from stdin of zelfexec (via env var zSTDIN)
    
  - arg0 can be spoofed (via env var zELFSPOOF)
    
  - arg1 is always treated as a child-process argument and never as a file to be executed
    
  - fallback mode (omnibin)
    


examples:

  basic use:

    command: fox-fr /path/to/busybox | zelfexec whoami

    output: $USER


  arg0 spoofing:

    command: fox-fr /path/to/busybox | zELFSPOOF="whoami" zelfexec

    output: $USER


  child-process stdin handling:

    command: fox-fr /path/to/busybox | zSTDIN="some text" zelfexec cat

    output: "some text"



notes:

  requires linux > 3.17, and fexecve to be enabled and usable by the current user. If these conditions are unmet, zelfexec will utilize fallback mode "omnibin".

  fallback mode requires read, write, and execute permissions in either /tmp or $HOME
